commonMethods.tsv
 - list of methods and the information of the tool - intersection 
 
commonConnections.tsv
 - list of calls and the information of the tool - intersection
 
commonMethodCalls.tsv
 - list of calls that are between nodes that were found by every tool. (filtering applied to commonConnection.tsv) 

*_initial_tables.csv
 - contains tables about the graph comparison made by our tool

 
#Filtering
Every filtering was applied to the previous result. The initial result is the result created by our tool (commonConnections.tsv)
 
#filter 1
Calls_filter_WALALAMBDA.tsv
 - file that contains results after eliminating possible calls connected to methods like "wala.lambda..."

#filter 2
Calls_filter_STATICINIT.tsv
 - file that contains results after elimination extra static initialization calls generated by Soot.
 
#filter 3
Calls_filter_JAVA_SUN.tsv
 - file that contains results after eliminating java and sun library methods thus calls connected to them. 3rd party calls possible.

#filter 4
Calls_filter_OnlyProject.tsv
 - file contains results after elimination every library method thus calls connected to them. (Only calls between project methods remain)
 
#filter 5
Calls_filter_EveryToolMethod.tsv
 - file that contains results after leaving calls only that are connected to nodes that were found by every tool.
 
Methods_filter_*:
 - files that contain the list of methods after filtering the corresponding "Calls_filter_" file.

*_TABLE.tsv:
 - files that contain results in table format (same as used in the paper) for the corresponding files.
